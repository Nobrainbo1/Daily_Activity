## 🐛 Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: Start Button Does Nothing
**Solution:**
1. Open browser console (F12)
2. Click the Start button
3. Look for errors
4. If you see "Cannot read property '_id'", the API response is wrong

### Issue 2: Design Doesn't Look Modern
**Solution:**
1. Hard refresh: `Ctrl + Shift + R` (Windows) or `Cmd + Shift + R` (Mac)
2. Clear browser cache

4. Restart Next.js dev server:
   ```powershell
   # Stop the server (Ctrl+C)

   ```

### Issue 3: Stats Show 0 or Wrong Numbers
**Solution:**
1. Make sure you have activities added (go to /activities and add some)

### Issue 5: Animated Blobs Not Moving
