| **📊 My Activities** | `/user-activity` | View your activities |

## 📊 **WHAT GETS SAVED:**

The form creates an Activity document in MongoDB with:

```javascript
{
  _id: ObjectId("..."), // Auto-generated
  name: "Your Activity Name",
  category: "Fitness",
  difficulty: "Beginner",
  duration: 15,
  description: "Your description",
  steps: [
    {
      stepNumber: 1,
      title: "Step Title",
      description: "Step description",
      tips: ["Tip 1", "Tip 2"],
      videoUrl: "https://...",
      estimatedDuration: 3
    },
    // ... more steps
  ],
  createdAt: Date,
  updatedAt: Date
}
```

This is the **exact same format** as the seed script, ensuring full compatibility!
